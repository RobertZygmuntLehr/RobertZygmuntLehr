# About Me

### Data Science Skills

I am on a journey exploring the world of data science. My skill set includes proficiency in Excel, Python, SQL, Tableau, R, and more. I am continuously expanding my expertise through a Data Visualization and Analytics BootCamp.

### Notable Projects

- **Traffic Incident Visualization:** At the Center for Transportation Research, I utilized R, ggplot, and Leaflet to visualize traffic incident locations, enabling data-driven decisions for transportation improvements.

- **Data Visualization and Analytics BootCamp Projects:** During the BootCamp, I completed several practical projects showcasing my data analysis and visualization skills. Some of the projects I've worked on include:
  - [Visualizing The Great Freeze - Texas Energy Prices Across Sectors](https://github.com/DataScience-Skills/Project-3-Visualizing-Data)
  - [Live Geospatial Data Visualization](https://github.com/DataScience-Skills/Live-Geospatial-Data-Visualization)
  - [Biodiversity Exploration Dashboard](https://github.com/DataScience-Skills/Belly-Button-Biodiversity-Exploration-Dashboard)

### Goals and Aspirations

As a data scientist, my goal is to leverage data for positive impact, driving innovation in businesses and contributing to meaningful solutions. I am particularly interested in applying my skills in domains related to higher education, sustainable and resilience design, energy conservation, music, and innovative startups.
