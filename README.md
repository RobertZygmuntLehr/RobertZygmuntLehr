# About Me

## Hi, ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a passionate data scientist with a background in scientific research and sustainable design. I thrive on using data to uncover patterns and insights that can drive innovation and improve businesses and products.

### Education and Background

I have a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Southwestern University, where I developed a strong foundation in analytical thinking and problem-solving. Additionally, I pursued a Master of Science in Sustainable Design from the University of Texas at Austin School of Architecture. This unique combination of mathematical expertise and sustainable design principles enables me to approach data science challenges from a multidisciplinary perspective.

During my time as a scientific research assistant at the Center for Transportation Research, I honed my skills in R, PSQL, Python, and command line. This experience provided me with a solid foundation in statistical analysis, data manipulation, and visualization.

### Data Science Skills

Continuously expanding my skill set is essential to my growth as a data scientist. Currently, I am enhancing my expertise through a Data Visualization and Analytics BootCamp. Here are some of the skills I have been developing:

- Excel and Excel VBA
- Python
- JavaScript
- SQL
- Command Line
- Tableau
- Leaflet
- Plotly
- APIs
- Web Scraping
- Machine Learning

### Notable Projects

#### Traffic Incident Visualization
At the Center for Transportation Research, I worked on a project where I visualized the locations of traffic incidents using R, ggplot, and Leaflet. By creating interactive visualizations, I was able to identify patterns and help stakeholders make informed decisions to improve transportation systems.

#### Data Visualization and Analytics BootCamp Projects
During my Data Visualization and Analytics BootCamp, I completed several projects that allowed me to apply my skills in a practical setting. Some of the projects I've worked on include:
